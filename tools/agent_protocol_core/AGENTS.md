# Agent Protocol Core

This repository contains only Agent Protocol, its offline validators, synthetic
tests and distribution tooling. Product behavior, credentials, production access,
application versions and paid infrastructure are outside its authority.

The accepted predecessor transfer record selects the initial exact tree and the
bootstrap contract. Neither a candidate nor a digest authenticates its own origin.
Read docs/agent-protocol/bootstrap.md before implementation or publication.
Once present on the accepted revision, read docs/agent-protocol/contract.md and
select phase/host/workstream procedures through the accepted documents manifest.
The compatibility corpus has its original identities and validators. Its embedded
product-specific entrypoint and workflows are historical test inputs, not current
instructions or executable GitHub workflows for this repository.

One durable ledger belongs to each PR/workstream. Preserve owners, authorizations,
errors and history. The engine evaluates evidence; an authorized host performs
writes after refreshing expected heads. Reconcile uncertain writes before retrying.
Never edit an unrelated PRODUCT checkpoint, weaken local policy or grant capabilities.

After each milestone state what was verified, one next action and its operational
location, then remaining milestones. Continue authorized work in the same session.
Only a real handoff needs a short resume prompt. Unknown measurements remain UNKNOWN.

Run python tools/check.py. All applicable exact-head CI, complete reviews/threads,
expected-head normal merge and post-merge checks are mandatory. No deployment exists.
Do not publish a release until the final contract, accepted revision, artifacts and
conformance agree. The bootstrap tree itself is not the Protocol 1.5.0 release.
