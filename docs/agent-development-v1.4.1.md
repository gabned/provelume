# Agent Development Protocol 1.4.1 — Auditable Continuation and Portable Release Profiles

This release hardens the v1.4.0 orchestration overlay without changing any
v1.3.0 review gate or any v1.2/v1.2.1 lifecycle, effect, binding,
trusted-base change-control, release, publication, production, waiver, or
post-merge reconciliation gate.

The executable v2 contract is `tools/agent_protocol_v1_4_1.py`. The immutable
v1.4.0 compatibility validator remains `tools/agent_protocol_v1_4.py`.
Both are offline, stateless, connector-input-only tools. Neither can poll,
dispatch a workflow, enable auto-merge, access credentials, publish, deploy, or
run in the background.

## Contract versions

- `AGENT_DEVELOPMENT_PROTOCOL: 1.4.1`
- `LIFECYCLE_SCHEMA: 1.2`
- `CAMPAIGN_SCHEMA: 2`
- `HANDOFF_SCHEMA: 2`
- compatible input: `1.4.0 / CAMPAIGN_SCHEMA: 1`

Schema v2 adds history and identity; it does not turn a campaign into merge,
release, or production authority. Every critical `UNKNOWN` remains blocking.

## Corrected failure mode

The read-only S04 evidence demonstrates the v1 limitation:

1. owner PR #172 merged as
   `d63c1028b4f3751f752359f8b0f94a4d93bfe6dd`;
2. corrective PR #173 then merged as
   `8649b98aad969b32767f2a90492e4ce5d5969bd2`;
3. the schema v1 slice snapshot retained only #173, so the owner/correction
   lineage was overwritten even though the issue still described both.

Schema v2 replaces the singular PR fields with an ordered ledger. Issue #171,
the two merged PRs, campaign #160, and active S05 issue #174 are evidence only;
v1.4.1 does not edit them.

## Ordered owner/correction ledger

Every slice contains `pull_requests`, whose entries have exact keys:

```json
{
  "sequence": 1,
  "role": "OWNER",
  "pr": "#172",
  "state": "MERGED",
  "head_sha": "d1153d3038e3456faa1279d3187994528dffaf01",
  "merge_sha": "d63c1028b4f3751f752359f8b0f94a4d93bfe6dd"
}
```

The first entry is always `OWNER`; later entries are `CORRECTION`. Sequences
are contiguous, PR references are unique, and merged entries retain exact head
and merge SHAs. Closed, unmerged attempts remain `CLOSED`; they are not removed.
Only the final ledger entry may be `OPEN`, and a campaign may contain at most
one open owner or correction PR across all slices. A correction therefore
extends history instead of replacing it. A new commit on that one open PR
updates only its `head_sha` through a distinct `PR_SYNCHRONIZED` receipt; the PR
number and role remain immutable, and its final head is recorded before the
entry can become `MERGED` or `CLOSED`. An unmerged close uses `PR_CLOSED`; the
next correction is then appended without deleting the closed attempt.

## Append-only transition receipts

Every schema v2 campaign contains at least one receipt. A receipt records:

- a contiguous sequence and closed operation (`INITIALIZE`,
  `SCHEMA_MIGRATION`, or `STATE_TRANSITION`);
- one closed real GitHub resource event: issue, pull request, commit, workflow
  run, release, or deployment, plus its closed action and applicable terminal
  conclusion;
- SHA-256 of the predecessor and successor campaign state, where state excludes
  only the receipt list to avoid a circular digest;
- the previous receipt digest, deterministic idempotency key, and its own
  canonical digest.

The first native v2 receipt starts at the fixed genesis digest. A migrated
receipt starts at the canonical digest of its exact schema v1 input. Each later
predecessor digest must equal the previous successor, and each
`previous_receipt_sha256` must equal the prior receipt digest. The final
successor must equal the current campaign-state digest.

`append_transition_receipt()` accepts only an exact retained prefix, frozen
campaign identity and slice order, a valid successor snapshot, and a new GitHub
event. Replaying the already-applied final event against the unchanged state is
an idempotent no-op. Reusing it for different state, altering history, adding
two receipts at once, or supplying time/polling text as an event fails closed.
`validate_append_only()` compares predecessor and successor snapshots directly.
GitHub publication and later release verification are separate evidence:
publication consumes the exact `RELEASE` event, while verification consumes an
exact-head `WORKFLOW_RUN`, so neither receipt reuses the other event.

Workflow conclusions are a closed registry. `GATES_PASSED`, release
verification, deployment, and production verification require `SUCCESS`, while
`GATES_FAILED` requires a terminal non-success conclusion. A
`DEPLOYMENT/CREATED` event is non-terminal and cannot satisfy
`PRODUCTION_DEPLOYED` or `PRODUCTION_VERIFIED`; deployment evidence is either a
successful completed workflow run or `DEPLOYMENT/STATUS_SUCCEEDED`. Production
verification consumes a second successful GitHub event. Event reuse is checked
without the conclusion field, so rewriting only an outcome cannot create new
evidence.

Earlier schema v2 receipts without `conclusion` remain readable when the event
kind is non-ambiguous. Missing workflow or successful-deployment conclusions
fail closed. A deterministic schema 1 migration may preserve `UNKNOWN` only on
its single `SCHEMA_MIGRATION` receipt and never converts it into passed-gate,
deployment, or verification evidence.

A schema v1 snapshot can name a passed or verified state without retaining the
terminal workflow conclusion. Migration preserves that historical observation
but replaces any success-dependent next action with `WAITING_EVENT`. Only a
later, distinct exact-head `WORKFLOW_RUN/COMPLETED/SUCCESS` receipt may restore
the merge or checkpoint action.

## Joint campaign and handoff

Schema v2 handoffs carry `campaign_sha256`, the digest of the complete campaign
including its receipt chain. `build_bundle()` validates or migrates the
campaign, derives the handoff, binds its digest, renders the canonical report,
and validates the two together. `validate_bundle()` rejects a changed outcome,
release status, action, prompt, resume state, or campaign digest.

The human report remains exactly five lines, no more than 120
whitespace-delimited words, and contains exactly one `Next action`:

```text
Outcome: DELIVERED | BLOCKED | CAMPAIGN_COMPLETE | RESUME_REQUIRED.
Delivered: <one compact result>
Release: <one closed release status>.
Next action [<one closed type>]: <exactly one action>
Prompt: <exact prompt only for USER_ACTION_REQUIRED; otherwise NONE>
```

`RESUME_REQUIRED` is allowed only with machine reason `SESSION_LIMIT` and next
type `RESUME_SESSION`. It changes no campaign state and creates no receipt,
because a session boundary is not a GitHub event. It has no prompt and cannot
replace `BLOCKED`, `HUMAN_GATE`, or `CAMPAIGN_COMPLETE`. Resuming consumes the
same exact campaign and last receipt, so session exhaustion is distinct from a
technical blocker or a human decision.

## Portable closed release profiles

The profile is selected by exact repository identity. It is a ceiling and
cannot waive local gates.

| Repository | Closed profile | State model | Maximum envelope | Terminal boundary |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `gabned/provelume` | `GITHUB_ARTIFACT` | PR-local | `THROUGH_RELEASE` | exact GitHub version/build published and verified |
| `brickms/brickms` | `CODE_ONLY_PRODUCTION_B` | persistent checkpoint | `THROUGH_PRODUCTION_B` | exact reversible candidate deployed and verified |
| `maxithlon/maxithlon` | `DEPLOYMENT_LEVEL_C` | persistent checkpoint | `THROUGH_PRODUCTION_B` | explicit human Level C authorization, then exact deployment verification |
| `gabned/provelume.com` | `UPSTREAM_RELEASE_VERIFIED` | PR-local | `THROUGH_PRODUCTION_B` | exact upstream Core release verified before local candidate deployment |

The Maxithlon profile deliberately has no autonomous Level C envelope.
`DEPLOY_PRODUCTION_C` is valid only in `HUMAN_GATE` with
`LEVEL_C_AUTHORIZATION` and one exact human prompt. The BrickMS and site
production B profiles require `REVERSIBLE_PRODUCTION`. The site profile also
requires exact upstream repository, published version, published build SHA, and
`VERIFIED` state before its production B action. Core rejects every deployment
identity and production action.

The committed fixture
`.github/agent-protocol/conformance-v1.4.1.json` records the four profiles and
their exact GitHub heads observed read-only on 2026-09-03. It also retains the
#172 owner → #173 correction regression. The fixture is sanitized historical
conformance evidence, not a live checkpoint or authority source. Its
`writes_performed` value is `false` for every other repository.

## Train, versions, and builds

Schema v2 keeps six identities independently verifiable:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `train_id` | delivery campaign identity |
| `target_version` | intended semantic version |
| `published_version` | version actually public, or `NONE` |
| `candidate_build_sha` | exact qualified candidate, or `NONE` |
| `deployed_build_sha` | exact deployed source, or `NONE` |
| `published_build_sha` | exact source of the public artifact, or `NONE` |

For `GITHUB_ARTIFACT`, candidate and published builds must match and deployment
must remain `NONE`. Deployment profiles may have a candidate and deployed build
without claiming a GitHub publication; deployed must equal the qualified
candidate. `UPSTREAM_RELEASE_VERIFIED` records upstream version/build in a
separate nested identity and never conflates it with the site build.

A release train is not a release, a semantic version is not a build, and a
candidate is neither deployed nor published merely because its gates passed.

## Deterministic schema 1 → 2 migration

`migrate_campaign()` first validates the exact v1.4.0 schema. It then:

1. preserves campaign identity, order, authority, scope, checkpoint, inbox, and
   event; a success-dependent pending action is closed to `WAITING_EVENT` until
   new exact-head `SUCCESS` workflow evidence arrives;
2. maps the singular recorded PR into the first `OWNER` ledger entry;
3. maps legacy `build_sha` only to the identity justified by the legacy
   publication state;
4. assigns the repository's closed release profile;
5. emits one deterministic `SCHEMA_MIGRATION` receipt bound to the legacy
   GitHub resource and predecessor/successor digests.

No timestamp, network response, random value, or local path enters the result.
Repeated migration of the same v1 input produces identical bytes; migrating an
already-valid v2 campaign is an idempotent no-op.

Migration cannot recreate history already overwritten in schema v1. It retains
the recorded PR as `OWNER` and does not guess that it was a correction. Adding
older owner/correction entries requires separate, authorized reconciliation
against real GitHub issue and PR evidence. This release intentionally does not
migrate or modify #160.

Schema v1 handoffs remain valid through the unchanged v1.4.0 tool. They are not
independently upgraded: a v2 handoff is regenerated jointly from the migrated
campaign so its digest and one action cannot drift.

## Preserved v1.3 and repository gates

Before merge, the unchanged exact head still requires:

- exact base/head/path binding, ancestry, and mergeability;
- trusted-base v1.2.1 change control and exact effect prediction;
- final-head permanent CI and repository-required reviews;
- zero current technical findings and zero unresolved review threads;
- the opt-in-only v1.3 Codex review state machine;
- clean-room, deterministic build, release, publication, deployment, and
  production gates applicable to the repository profile;
- no agent-authored waiver;
- observational post-merge reconciliation.

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` is classified `KEEP_AND_HARDEN`: all existing job and
check names remain, while the clean-room job also executes the v1.4.1 self-test
and read-only conformance validation. No second workflow or background executor
is introduced.

## Offline commands

```

All generated operational evidence remains under ignored `.agent/`. Unknown
keys, open registry values, invalid identities, missing digests, rewritten
receipts, multiple open PRs, mismatched profiles, over-authority actions, or
overlong/drifted handoffs exit fail-closed with status 2.
