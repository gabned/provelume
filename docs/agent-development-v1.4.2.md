# Agent Development Protocol 1.4.2

Protocol 1.4.2 adds operational evidence to the auditable continuation contract.
The canonical implementation is developed in Core campaign
[#200](https://github.com/gabned/provelume/issues/200). Distribution is complete
only after that campaign contains the verified five-repository closure receipt.
A branch, issue, preliminary merge SHA or passing unit test is not distribution.

## Compatibility and authority

Lifecycle remains 1.2; campaign and handoff retain schema 2, discriminated by
`protocol_version`. The 1.4.0 and 1.4.1 validators and historical receipts remain
unchanged. Use the validator matching the recorded version. The new validator
can migrate schema 1 deterministically; it does not relabel existing 1.4.1
receipts as 1.4.2 proof. Operational receipts add `operational_evidence` to their
hashed content. Initialization and schema migration set it to null.

The operational distribution envelope is `NO_PRODUCTION`. All earlier lifecycle,
review, trusted-base change control, exact-head CI, checkpoint and release gates
remain mandatory. Maxithlon retains `DEPLOYMENT_LEVEL_C`, BrickMS retains
`CODE_ONLY_PRODUCTION_B`, and the site retains `UPSTREAM_RELEASE_VERIFIED`.
The descriptive registry does not become a runtime vendor or an authority source.
This protocol distribution does not publish a product version, tag or release,
deploy anything, access credentials, change environments or create `AGENT_STATUS.md`.

Workflow classification: `KEEP_AND_HARDEN` for `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
Existing checks, names, permissions and trusted-base execution remain; the
additional files receive executable-mode/offline checks and repository test coverage.

## Observation boundary

Evidence validation is offline and executes no commands. The synchronizer alone
reads local Git through fixed commands without a shell or network operation.
A JSON field saying `GITHUB_CONNECTOR` is
not authentication. The caller must collect complete observations through an
authorized connector, including pagination, actual PR and commit objects,
repository policy, CI attempts/jobs, review threads and maintainer identity.
Never synthesize missing observations from desired outcomes. Keep actual
snapshots under ignored `.agent/`; public tests use synthetic data only.

Current operations require observations within 15 minutes, with at most 30
seconds of clock skew. Historical campaign receipts validate their frozen
observations against their recorded PR observation time; replaying a historical
receipt does not authorize a new action. Every newly appended critical receipt
is checked against the current clock before its digest is generated.

## CI and waits

The retained trigger inventory includes `pull_request_review`, used by BrickMS
review governance. Its run/attempt history and success gate stay separate from
the same workflow triggered by `pull_request`.

Workflow event identity includes repository, run ID, exact head and
`run_attempt`. Attempt histories start at 1 and are contiguous. A previous
terminal attempt cannot be rewritten or removed. All workflow-run and job
pages must be complete. The latest attempt of the latest observed run for each
applicable workflow must succeed; an older green cannot cover a new pending or
failed run. A retained failure followed by an explicitly observed success is
valid history; validation never launches a rerun.

Workflow identity includes its trigger, expressed as `workflow@event` in the
required set. In particular, successful `pull_request_target` scope checks cannot
replace failing `pull_request` candidate tests from the same workflow file.
The run retains its separate `workflow` and closed `event` fields.
GitHub-managed checks can report `dynamic` (for example Code Quality); retain
that observed trigger and workflow path with the same attempt/history gates.
Do not omit it from the CI inventory or relabel it as a repository workflow.

`validate-wait` accepts only a freshly observed live run and the exact connector
handle ending in `/actions/runs/{id}/attempts/{attempt}`. Its deadline is bounded
to one hour. Expiry requests observation of that same handle and makes no
campaign transition. Elapsed time is not failure, completion or authorization.
Polling and automatic retries remain disabled.

## PR identity, exceptions and merge

The supported Protocol surfaces include BrickMS's existing
`scripts/agent/protocol-v1-2.py`, so exact metadata-path updates can preserve
its native NO_PRODUCTION effect gate. Similar unlisted paths remain rejected.

The PR observation includes `state`, `draft` and `mergeable`. Pre-merge gates
require an open, non-draft PR with observed mergeability exactly true; unknown
mergeability cannot authorize a merge. Post-merge evidence requires a closed,
non-draft PR plus the retained actual merge proof.

Campaign receipt replay uses the latest retained connector observation as its
clock anchor. Creation checks both the live clock and that same frozen window,
so sequential PR/CI/review/merge reads remain replayable without allowing stale
evidence to authorize a new action.

The PR snapshot carries exact repository, number, base, head, tree, complete
changed paths and patches. Its body must contain one matching `BASE_SHA`,
`HEAD_SHA`, `TREE_SHA` and `CHANGED_PATHS_COMPLETE: TRUE` declaration.
`render-pr-identity` replaces these declarations deterministically; it cannot
invent missing repository observations.
Changed paths and patch keys preserve valid Git whitespace/newline names as
atomic JSON strings without trimming or splitting. NUL, absolute paths, traversal
and noncanonical separators remain rejected; transport does not waive scope gates.

An authorized technical changelog exception binds the verified human maintainer,
authorization reference, PR, base/head, full path digest and exact patch digest.
The authorized patch must equal the observed patch and add exactly one technical
Protocol line to `CHANGELOG.md`, or append one indented technical continuation
directly after the existing Protocol 1.4.2 entry, without deleting any text or
creating a second entry. A continuation also requires existing explicit authority
covering its exact delta. It cannot waive another gate or authorize
product edits. Frozen baseline paths cannot contain paths absent from the PR.

Authorization can come from an actual GitHub maintainer comment or an existing
explicit user instruction. The latter retains the authoritative goal's thread ID,
creation timestamp and verbatim instruction, using a `codex-goal:THREAD:CREATED_AT`
reference. This is a provenance identifier, not a web link or a fabricated GitHub
comment. The caller must verify that the instruction covers the proposed exception;
the receipt binds that existing authority to the exact current patch. It cannot
expand authority, waive gates or require a duplicate approval for work already
authorized. `authorization_source` is `GITHUB_COMMENT` or `USER_INSTRUCTION`.

Post-merge evidence requires observed merged/closed state, the actual merge
commit, accepted tree, squash or merge parents and ancestry from the current
default commit. A provisional GitHub merge SHA is insufficient. Applicable
post-merge CI must bind that observed default commit.
Before merging, the collector must compare the freshly observed default SHA with
the accepted PR base, not only the PR API's retained base field. If they differ,
reconstruct the candidate on the current default and require new exact-head CI.
Each hashed operation requires an independent `default_branch` observation with
repository, name, SHA, connector source and timestamp. The validator requires its
SHA to equal the accepted base before merge and the ancestry default after merge;
missing, stale, wrong-branch or mismatched observations cannot authorize gates.
Immutable campaign receipts written by the earlier 1.4.2 implementation retain
their exact legacy operation shape without `default_branch`. Read-only replay
accepts that closed shape only when the complete receipt digest is pinned in an
independent trusted pre-upgrade history allowlist and its canonical hash matches.
Absence of the new proof alone never identifies a receipt as legacy. Replay uses
the original observation anchor and does not invent a default. Every new gate/merge
transition and every final audit still requires the current shape. A campaign
can append a newly evidenced transition while preserving its prior receipts
byte-for-byte. Current-shape archived records retain all default checks.

Capture the allowlist from an independently verified, immutable pre-upgrade
checkpoint, never from the candidate being validated or from modified/resealed
evidence. Supply `--legacy-receipts trusted-policy.json` before the CLI command;
the policy contains only `{"receipt_sha256s": ["<verified 64-hex receipt digest>"]}`.
Python callers use `with trusted_legacy_receipts(verified_digests):` around replay,
continuation or bundle validation. The policy is scoped to that call and never
serialized into the campaign or synthesized from a missing field. If verified
history is unavailable, legacy replay blocks until that source is recovered.
This compatibility policy cannot waive current action, scope or final-audit gates.
An integration whose actual tree or parent differs from accepted evidence is not
a qualified operation. Retain that actual merge and its anomaly without rewriting
its former head/base, then qualify the current tree through a separate correction.
Only qualified integration operations may certify the final default; retained
terminal ledgers can also preserve merged attempts that did not meet those gates.
Its policy reference also binds that current default; an older policy cannot
omit checks added by the audited default. All latest observed applicable workflows
must succeed; the required set is a minimum inventory, not a waiver for other runs.

For Protocol campaigns, `GATES_PASSED` and `PR_MERGED` receipts require operational
evidence embedded in the receipt digest. The validator binds the evidence to
the retained PR/head and the exact workflow attempt or actual merge. Dropping
the evidence and recomputing the outer digest still fails validation.

## Late findings and closure

Every integration operation in the final audit must declare exactly one
`CAMPAIGN_REF` in its observed PR body, equal to the audited campaign URL.
Missing, duplicate or unrelated references cannot certify campaign completion.
The same check covers the retained original and corrective integrations inside
every late finding, including frozen audit replay.

A late finding records both the original merged PR/build and a separately
reconciled corrective PR. A resolved label alone is insufficient: the observed
thread resolution must bind the original head and corrective head/merge.
The original merge's freshly observed default ancestry must contain the exact
corrective commit before the original endpoint. This proves correction follows
origin, allows intervening commits, and rejects older or unrelated merges.
The prior terminal ledger must be an exact prefix of the retained ledger;
the correction is appended, without reopening or replacing an old entry.

Vendor synchronization compares the Git-significant owner executable bit on POSIX,
not a fixed full permission mask. Updates preserve other existing permission bits;
new files respect the process umask. Restrictive 0700/0600 checkouts remain valid
and synchronization does not broaden their group or other permissions.
Rollback atomically replaces originals, so a read-only installed file never needs
to be reopened for writing when a later replacement fails.

`generate-audit` validates exactly five repositories and emits a digest-bound
receipt accepted directly by `validate-audit`. Each repository supplies its
profile, default commit, actual integration evidence and applicable CI/reviews.
Open campaign PRs, unresolved findings, missing repositories, stale observations
and vendor drift block closure. The canonical source must be an audited Core
merge. Observed vendor bytes bind their default commits and must match the
canonical SHA-256, Git blob and mode. The registry supplies its locally selected
path, blob and final provenance; private paths/content are never fixtures in Core.
The registry path must be part of its actual integration, and its content must
identify all four executable repositories, final defaults and integration PRs.
Downstream generated manifest and provenance documents also require exact bytes,
Git blobs and modes observed at their respective default commits. Core has no
self-referential committed source manifest.

`generate-audit` enforces live freshness. `validate-audit` verifies the protected
digest and replays all nested observations against the receipt's original audit
time, so archived proof remains verifiable without refreshing its timestamps.
Generation also validates that original time anchor before emitting a receipt.
Historical validation never establishes current readiness or authorizes a new action.

## Offline synchronization

`sync-vendor SOURCE TARGET --commit COMMIT` copies the four explicitly listed
validator files and generates a manifest and provenance document. It performs
no network operation or product edit. `--check` reports drift without writes.
Symlink targets and paths outside the selected repository are rejected. The
source must be a clean Git root with the canonical Core origin and HEAD exactly
equal to COMMIT. Committed blobs and modes must match the source files; ignored
Git replacement objects cannot substitute content. The caller still verifies
that COMMIT is the intended public canonical merge through its authorized connector.
POSIX replacements apply and verify the declared permissions, and rollback
restores prior bytes and permissions. Mode-only drift fails `--check`. Windows
does not expose POSIX executable bits: the caller must stage and verify the
declared Git modes in the target index/tree before publication on every platform.
Git reads disable lazy fetching and all transports, including inherited transport
permissions; a missing promisor object fails locally without contacting a remote.

The new command interfaces are exposed by `tools/agent_protocol_v1_4_2.py`.
Operational input shapes and positive/adversarial examples are executable in
`tests/test_agent_protocol_v1_4_2_ops.py`. Repository CI runs these alongside the
unchanged earlier-protocol regressions and the full Core suite.
